## **A. PERSONAL STATEMENT**

I am a Biologist trained in integrative neuroscience as well as a certified Psychologist specializing in developmental child psychology. My work focuses on functional brain development during the perinatal period and its links with neurodevelopmental trajectories. My research lies at the intersection of sensory perception, human neurodevelopment, and psychopathology.

During my thesis and postdoctoral work, I combined non-invasive methods (fNIRS, DCS, and HR-EEG) for measuring brain activity in newborns. My recruitment as an Assistant Professor at the University of Caen enabled me to capitalize on these results to develop research into neonatal cognition. My research program focuses on:

1. Highlighting early cognitive mechanisms by measuring neonatal brain activity.
2. Understanding the links between these mechanisms and later cognitive development.
3. Assessing these mechanisms as neonatal markers of neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) risk.

Funded studies (e.g., Fondation de France, ANR, and Perce-Neige Foundation) have explored sensory prediction, neurovascular responses, and attentional development in preterm infants, with follow-ups assessing their cognitive and physiological self-regulation at age 2. My long-term goal is to understand the neonatal prodromal aspects of pathological neurodevelopmental trajectories and provide intervention markers.
